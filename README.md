#XOSPApps

  - What those are?
  From Release 2 Revision 2 XOSP will be build in a different kind of way. In order to allow the Maintainer to choose what apps to include in their builds i decided to create a separate package which it will be available to be flashed right after the ROM flashing process.
 - How to build them?
 You don't need to do anything, the build environment will do that for you right after you start the compilation process for your device and it will automatically create a flashable zip to the out folder of your target device. 

##NOTES

  - The XOSPApps package is only available for XOSP users so do not try to flash them on other custom ROMs cause the flash processs will fail 
  - For the Maintainers, once you got the build uploaded on the thread, DO NOT forget to mention also the fact to flash the XOSPApps right after the ROM otherwise the user will find his phone into a botloop
