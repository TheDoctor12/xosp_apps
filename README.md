#XOSPApps

  - What those are?
  From Release 2 Revision 2 S+ Reborn will be build in a different kind of way. In order to allow the Maintainer to choose what apps to include in their build i decided to create a separate package which it will be available to be flashed right after the ROM flashing process.
 - How to build them?
 You don't need to do anything, the build environment will do that for you right after you start the compilation process for your device and it will automatically create a flashable zip to the out folder of your target device. 

##NOTE

  - XOSPApps are made to be flashable on S+ Reborn ROM so i suggest you to don't flash them on other kind of ROM.
